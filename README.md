# CraftQuesty
Questy in the form of a Bukkit plugin to demonstrate how it can be used.

CraftQuesty does not use maven due to the legal issues involved with distributing CraftBukkit or forks of it. Apologies for any inconvenience as a result of this fact. Dependencies must be added locally. Though it is less than ideal, Quest itself must also be locally added for the time being, though this will be sorted out at some point.

Please note that there is no guarantee CraftQuesty will be functional in any way if you build it, as neither Questy nor CraftQuesty are currently complete or fully tested.
